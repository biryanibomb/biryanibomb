      question: "How many cubes do I use?",
      answer: "1 cube per person. Add more as needed. It's that simple!"
    },
    {
      question: "Can I add meat or vegetables?",
      answer: "Yes! Cook separately and mix with rice after adding the cube. The flavor cube enhances whatever you add."
